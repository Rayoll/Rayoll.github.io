**Multi-E2E: An end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating high-resolution remote sensing images and multi-source geographical data**

**Ruiyi Yang**, Yu Su, Yanfei Zhong

[**Code**](https://github.com/Rayoll/Multi_E2E) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>

- This work proposes an end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating high-resolution remote sensing images and multi-source geographic data (Multi-E2E). The Multi-E2E framework automatically establishes the mapping from multi-source data to land-use categories through a data-driven approach.

[Self-supervised joint representation learning for urban land-use classification with multisource geographic data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10855160/)

**Ruiyi Yang**, Yu Su, Yanfei Zhong

- This paper introduces a self-supervised joint representation learning (SJRL) framework for urban land-use classification with multisource geographic data. For the high-resolution remote sensing images, a semantic-aware self-supervised representation approach is employed to mine the significant visual information of the HRS images. For the points of interest (POIs), a context-aware self-supervised representation learning approach is designed to investigate the spatial distribution patterns of POIs.

[Urban land-use classification with multi-source self-supervised representation learning and correlation modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10642159)

**Ruiyi Yang**, Yu Su, Yanfei Zhong

- This work proposes an urban land-use classification framework with multi-source self-supervised representation learning and correlation modeling (LUSC). This framework introduces self-supervised approaches for HRS images and POIs to mine the multi-source representations from parcels.
