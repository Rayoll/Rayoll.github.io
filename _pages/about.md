Multi-E2E: An end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating high-resolution remote sensing images and multi-source geographical data

**Ruiyi Yang**, Yu Su, Yanfei Zhong

- This work proposes an end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating high-resolution remote sensing images and multi-source geographic data (Multi-E2E). The Multi-E2E framework automatically establishes the mapping from multi-source data to land-use categories through a data-driven approach.
